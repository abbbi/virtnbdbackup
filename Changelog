  features.
 * If no disks suitable for backup are detected or backup fails, save at least
 virtual machine configuration and related kernel/uefi files (#93)

 workers are used, not how much disks are attached, log correct port range use
 during offline backup.

Development:
 * Github workflow now saves all files created by testsuite for better
 analysis, extend some testcases.


Version 1.9.6
---------
 * virtnbdrestore: add detection for disks with volume notation, reset
 type to file during restore so virtual machine config is adjusted to
 new restore paths. (#81)

Version 1.9.4
---------
 * Code cleanup: more type annotations, correctly catch ssh exceptions.

 (#82) port used by remote NBD Service must be unique.  Also report used
 ports in logfile.


Version 1.9.3
---------
 * Move function call for backing up qemu disk information outside worker
 threads: should fix occasional "Fatal Python error: _enter_buffered_busy"
 error during backup.


Version 1.9.2
---------
 * Return function if gathering qemu disk info fails for some reason.
 * If remote backup is saved to local zip file, backup may fail because
 absolute path to additional loader/nvram files is wrong.
 * Fix naming if copy backup is saved to zip file output: dont append
 checkpoint information to created files.


Version 1.9.1
---------
 * Code cleanup: fix pylint warning, remove obsolete p.wait() calls with
 hardcoded time limit, start adding type annotations, reworked imports.
 * Fix disk detection with volume notation. (#81)
 * Backup and restore qcow image related settings: during backup
 qemu-img info is called on qcow based image devices and qcow specific options
 are stored as json dump. If information is existent, on restore the
 original settings of the qcow image (such as cluster size or other options)
 are now applied during image creation. (#80)
 * Fix some race conditions during restore of multiple disks and sequences: NBD
 connection handle was not closed, following qemu-nbd calls would fail due
 to locked files or already in use tcp ports.


Development:
 * Change github workflows: now use ubuntu 22.04 and add test for remote
 backup via localhost.


Version 1.9
---------
 * Update README
 * Make --compress option configurable, it is now possible to set
 compression level (--compress=X) (#77)

Version 0.89
---------
* virtnbdrestore: check if additional boot files such as nvram/kernel images
exist and if not, restore them to the original path instead of just warning
the user about manual steps being required.

Version 0.88
---------
* virtnbdrestore: Allow restore into non-empty directories, so one can
restore the disk files into an existing libvirt managed volume directory.
If the restore target path is an libvirt managed pool, refresh the

 instead of running into "Cannot acquire state change lock" timeout exception.

Version 0.76
---------
* virtnbdbackup:
 + Change some log messages: more detailed report on skipped devices during backup.
 + Add option --freeze-mountpoint: during backup, only filesystems of
 specified mountpoints are freezed and thawed. (#60)
* virtnbdrestore:

Version 0.69
---------
* Code cleanup
* virtnbdbackup: exit early if removing checkpoints fails during full
backup.
* virtnbdrestore: do not write zeroes during restore of image, as the
resulting zeroed regions are then reported as being "data": this would result
in further backups of the virtual machine to be thick provisioned, as even
zeroed regions are saved. (#56)
* virtnbdrestore: dont adjust vm config if option -c is missing.
* virtnbdrestore: now removes existent backing stores if adjust setting is
enabled: usually the case if virtual machine operated on snapshot during

* Update README

Version 0.62
---------
* Add script to create virtualenv with required dependencies.
* virtnbdmap now supports mounting of full->incremental (or differential)
chains: the current approach is to use the nbdkit COW (copy on write) filter
to replay the data blocks against the mapped nbd device.

Version 0.61
---------
* Add vagrant scripts
* Print libvirt library version.
* Disable xml based check if incremental backup capability is enabled for
libvirt versions > 8002000: feature is enabled by default. (#4)

Version 0.56
---------
* Fix for Issue (#40): redefining checkpoints fails

Version 0.55
---------
* Correct some wrongly caught exceptions
* Update README


Version 0.54
---------
* (#38) Backup virtual machines loader bios and nvram if defined, provide
notice to user during restore that files must be copied manually.
* virtnbdrestore: Fixes for --until option:
	+ would not stop processing further files since --sequence option was introduced
	+ would stop before actually processing specified checkpoint, now function
	stops after restoring data of checkpoint to be reached.
	+ extend tests
* Update README

Version 0.53
---------
* Cleanup codebase
* Fix differential backup for offline domains: apply same logic as during
incremental backup.

* Group possible options in help output
* Introduce more exceptions, cleanup codebase.

Version 0.51
---------

Version 0.50
---------
* Fix sequence restore: function returned too early.
* Parameter for --sequence option does not require absolute path anymore.


Version 0.49
---------
* virtnbdrestore now support restoring a manual sequence of data files
passed by the --sequence option.

Version 0.48
---------

* Internal code changes: start using proper exceptions if stream format
is not parseable
* virtnbdbrestore: add --sequence option, allows to specify a comma separated
list of backup files whose information should be dumped. Next step is to
implement restore of a specified sequence.


Version 0.47
---------
* Fix issue #37: If an backup directory contains multiple differential
or incremental backups, its not possible to use the --until option for
point in time restore, because the differential backups defaulted to
the first checkpoint name in the metadata header. Recover would
stop too early in such cases..

Now the checkpoint name in the metadata header contains the same timestamp as
the target files, which make it possible to use the --until option too.

Version 0.46
---------
* Add changelog file

Version 0.45
---------
* Adds differential backup option: backup option -l diff now saves the
delta since the last incremental or full backup. Option -q now uses
nbdinfo instead of qemu-img map, which supports reading specific bitmap
information: now option -q can be used during incremental/differential backup
too,which might be good for debugging issues.
* If incremental backup for offline Domain is attempted, backup would save all
data, not just dirty extents: now saves only dirty extents.  
* Extends the testsuite with tests for the implemented new features
* Fixes various pylint warnings, better error handling in some situations.
* Update documentation and executable dependencies for the debian package build.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/abbbi/virtnbdbackup/compare/v0.44...v0.45

Version 0.44
---------
Ensure checkpoint chain consistency:

As discussed during issue #33, the "parent" option to a checkpoint
created is readonly currently. Thus, virtnbdbackup can not force
an parent checkpoint during creation of the actual checkpoints.
    
This means we cannot ensure that the complete checkpoint chain
we are based on for the current incremental backup is entirely
created by us, like so:
    
   > virsh checkpoint-list vm1 --tree
   > virtnbdbackup.0                                                    r
   >   |
   >   +- virtnbdbackup.1
   >       |
   >       +- virtnbdbackup.2
   >           |
   >           +- not-our-checkpoint

The delta for "not our checkpoint" would never be saved because
we dont know about this checkpoint.

Now virtnbdbackup checks for checkpoints which might have been
created by users or third party applications and exits with
error if incremental or full backup is attempted.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/abbbi/virtnbdbackup/compare/v0.43...v0.44

Version 0.43
---------
Remove --checkpoint option: has never behaved the way it should. The parent
option to a checkpoint XML definition is, according to the documentation read
only. So currently its not supported to force a specific checkpoint using this
option.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/abbbi/virtnbdbackup/compare/v0.42...v0.43

Version 0.42
---------
* Fixes some pylint/flake8 warnings.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/abbbi/virtnbdbackup/compare/v0.41...v0.42

Version 0.41
---------
Minor code changes regards checkpoint handling, fix some pylint warnings.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/abbbi/virtnbdbackup/compare/v0.40...v0.41

Version 0.40
---------
Introduce custom handler for logging facility to track number of warnings
during backup operation.

Recent changes introduce a new logging facility handler that counts the number
of warnings during backup (for example if qemu agent is not
reachable etc..)

If option "--strict" is set during backup, the exit code will now set to
2.

This allows calling applications or scripts to have a more detailed
error handling in regards to warnings and/or errors.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/abbbi/virtnbdbackup/compare/v0.39...v0.40

Version 0.39
---------
Adds full support for offline domains:

* Allows for incremental backup of offline domains: changed data for last
checkpoint will be saved until a new checkpoint is created.  * Adds proper
error handling for cases where starting the NBD server for offline domains
causes error

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/abbbi/virtnbdbackup/compare/v0.38...v0.39

Version 0.38
---------
Add support for backup of shutdown domains (#27)

Usually virtnbdbackup makes most sense while operating
on running domains. Only if a virtual domain is running,
checkpoints can be defined via libvirt API and the
required backup operations can be executed. The qemu
Process will then start the NBD backend in order to
receive the backup data.

With the recent changes, virtnbdbackup now detects
if the backup source is offline and then:

 * Forces the backup mode to "copy": no full or
 incremental backup supported because we can't create
 an checkpoint via libvirt API. Copy type backup
 is like a full backup just without checkpoint.
 * Forces the amount of workers to 1
 * Starts an NBD Process via qemu-nbd for each disk, operating
 directly on the Virtual Disk files as detected from the VM
 configuration.
 * Queries required extents and data from the NBD
 Service and saves it accordingly.

Full changeset:

Version 0.13
---------
Write backup to partial file first

In case backup utility receives signal or fails otherwise,
the backup data is written to the regular target file and
it is assumed everything is OK.

Now virtnbdbackup writes the data to a partial file first
and renames the file as last step. During incremental
backup the target directory is checked for possible existence
of partial backups and backup is aborted with error.
